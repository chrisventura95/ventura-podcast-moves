# Common moves in podcasting

I watched the first two episodes of *Homecoming* and the first two episodes of *Serial*. While *Homecoming* is fiction and *Serial* is non-fiction, both podcasts are under the mystery genre and share common elements.

The shared elements are:
1. Organization: **Non-linear**
2. Style: **Moody sound effects**
3. Narrative types: **Interviews** and **conversations**

## Organization

Both podcasts are not necessarily presented in chronological order; instead, they are presented in a **non-linear** format that prioritizes suspense.

### *Homecoming*

This is most evident in episode one: "Mandatory." The episode jumps between Bergman interviewing Cruz (the past) to Carrasco finding Bergman (the future). Future Bergman is hesitant to talk about her sessions with Cruz. This creates suspense because Future Bergman is so bitter towards the sessions. The listener is left to wonder if something terrible happened with Walter in the past.

### *Serial*

The non-linear format is present in *Serial* but to a lesser extent. Koenig does not provide every little detail in the order that it occurred from the murder to the arrest to the court cases. Instead, the episodes are split up to cover certain topics: the first episode is about McClain, a girl who might have had an alibi for Syed while he was on trial for Lee's murder. The second episode is about Syed's relationship with Lee before she was murdered.

## Style

Both podcasts incorporate **moody sound effects** to set the tone for what is happening. The music is used strategically - it is not frequent; rather, it is used at very specific times, sometimes while somebody is talking, sometimes without anybody talking, to make the listener feel a certain way.

### *Homecoming*

In episode two, "Pineapple," sound effects are played in between flash backs and flash forwards, particularly at the 10:24 mark. Walter has a tense discussion with Schreyer about their placement in a new facility. Following their argument, an ominous symphony plays. In tune with the idea of suspense, it makes listeners uncomfortable as the music goes deeper and deeper. It implies that something terrible is about to happen.

### *Serial*

In episode one, "The Alibi," the main theme is played at 23:48. Keyboard notes are hit at a consistent rate, which creates a sense of mystery. It also creates unease due to the repeated sound that doesn't seem to change. Additionally, it plays while Koenig is talking about the time frame of Lee's murder. This emphasizes the importance of the time frame, as Syed could not have murdered her if there was proof he was somewhere else during this time frame. As a result, the music helps the listener focus on essential information.

## Narrative types

This is where the podcasts differentiate the most. The episodes of *Homecoming* are presented strictly through **interviews** and **conversations**. Meanwhile, *Homecoming* is a combination of **narration**, **interviews**, and **conversations**.

### *Homecoming*

**Interviews** and **conversations** place the listener straight into the action, as if he or she is with the main characters as they are talking. The listener can react the same way the characters do while information is being presented to them. This creates an engaging storytelling experience. For example, in "Pineapple" at 17:10, Cruz discusses the humorous story of *Titanic Rising*. As Bergman laughs, the listener also laughs because they are both essentially listening to the story at the same time.

### *Serial*

In addition to **interviews** and **conversations**, **narration** is heavily used in *Serial*. Koenig already knows everything that happened as she tells the story to the listener, and her narration serves as a guide as she looks back on the evidence. As opposed to *Homecoming*, the listener doesn't feel like he or she is put in the middle of the situation. Instead, the listener is given past conversations while Koenig has the power to stop and start them at will, providing her own commentary on the matters at hand. Similar to the **non-linear** format and **moody sound effects**, this adds to a suspenseful experience. For example, in "The Alibi" at 12:48, before Koenig presents a conversation clip, she warns the listener that the tape is "a little upsetting to hear at parts." The listener has to prepare himself or herself, wondering what kind of upsetting words might be said.
